BprImport - a simple CLI tool used for importing information from text files
into Cisco's Broadband Access Center (BAC) software suite. It is written in Java
and uses Cisco's BAC API libraries (bpr.jar and bacbase.jar).

Compile
-------

Compiling and running the applications require the bpr.jar and bacbase.jar be in your classpath. I can't include these libraries with the code they have to be obtained through Cisco.





Usage 
-----

bprimport <rdu hostname or ip> <port> <user> <password> <text file>

The <text file> must be pipe deliminated in the following format:

ownerid|macaddress|classofservice

000CE532D06A|1,6,00:0C:E5:32:D0:6A|silver
